A python script that updates a local project by its 
Github remote repo. It also has some special actions
to improve performance such as moving the node modules
file to the new directory instead of outright deleting.

Important Information: This project is now deprecated(I won't do more commits)
since in the day when I started and finished this I
found that git fetch and git oull existed to do a 
very similiar task. Even so I won't delete it so
I can look a few years into the future and laugh at this.
